## Description
This repository contains the complete source code for my blog post titled [Tic-Tac-Toe with React, Redux, Rust - Part 1](https://v2.voidst.one/blog/tic-tac-toe-with-react-redux-rust-part-1/).

## Project Notes

The package-lock.json file in the React project was generated on an ARM64 processor.

If you are using an AMD64 (x86_64) system, please delete the existing package-lock.json file and run `npm install` to regenerate it for your architecture.
